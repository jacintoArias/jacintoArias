          exreport started as a "bunch of useful scripts" that one colleage and
          me were developing to make our life much easier during our grad student
          period. It became something bigger, structurated and at the end a fully
          mature tool that has been very valuable to ourselves and our lab colleages.
          We hope this project can spread out and be of use to other scientists as well.
